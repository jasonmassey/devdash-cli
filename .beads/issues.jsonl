Current behavior: .devdash file in repo root sets project_id and api_url, but this creates friction when switching between projects. Issues to solve: (1) Agent sessions (Claude Code) start in one project dir but may reference another project's tasks — the .devdash config is tied to cwd, (2) 'devdash init' overwrites .devdash if switching projects, (3) No way to quickly switch active project context without cd-ing to a different repo, (4) Multiple repos might map to the same devdash project (monorepo subtrees). Possible approaches: (a) 'devdash project switch <name>' that updates a global active project in ~/.config/dev-dash/active-project, (b) DD_PROJECT_ID env var already works as override — document and promote this, (c) project name aliases in ~/.config/dev-dash/projects.json for quick reference, (d) 'devdash context' command that shows which project is active and why (from .devdash, env var, or global default).

Read bin/devdash fully to understand the command pattern (see dd_list, dd_ready, dd_create, etc.)\n2. Add a dd_sync() function following the same pattern as other commands\n3. The sync command should:\n   - Get the project_id using dd_project_id()\n   - Call dd_api POST \"/sync\" with projectId in the request body\n   - Handle the response and display appropriate success/error messages\n4. Wire the new function into the main command dispatcher at the bottom of the script (in the case statement that matches command names)\n5.
